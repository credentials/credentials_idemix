/**
 * <p>A builder for {@link ProofList}s, for creating cryptographically bound proofs of knowledge. It works as
 * follows.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>When adding a credential for which some attributes should be disclosed, or the commitment to the secret
 *     key and v_prime for a new credential (see {@link #addProofD(IdemixCredential, List)} and
 *     {@link #addCredentialBuilder(CredentialBuilder)} respectively), a Pedersen commitment to randomness
 *     (see the {@link IdemixCredential.Commitment} and {@link CredentialBuilder.Commitment} classes) is made
 *     for each of the numbers that are to be kept secret (the first step in the Schnorr Sigma-protocol).</li>
 *     <li>When building the proofs using {@link #build()}, the challenge for the second step in the Schnorr
 *     Sigma-protocol is calculated, as the hash over the context, the commitments and the elements of which
 *     knowledge is being proved, and the nonce. Using this the responses (the third step of the Sigma-protocol) are
 *     calculated and a new {@link ProofList} is populated.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
